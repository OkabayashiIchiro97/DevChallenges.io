This was my first project, I haven't many problems with HTML, however there
is a bit of lack of experience in CSS, I pretend to edit this after learning
JavaScript with Dark Theme or others ideas.
There is another topics from CSS that I want to study more
Hope you enjoyed and leave a feedback if possible
